- Stanislav Grof, **Realms of the Human Unconscious** (1975) & **Holotropic Breathwork**
- Michael Pollan, **How to Change Your Mind** (2018) – mainstream synthesis

### Phenomenology & Entity Catalogues
- “Entities” project survey (>14k DMT reports)
- Benny Shanon’s ayahuasca archetypes vs. DMT-Nexus lexicon

### Technology-Mediated States
- Neural-feedback induced “Hyperscanning” studies (2020-)
- VR-assisted psychedelic therapy pilots (e.g., Lu et al., 2022)

### Safety, Ethics & Integration
- Fireside Project, **Psychedelic Peer Support Line** – https://firesideproject.org/
- Johns Hopkins “Psychedelic Safety Guidelines” (2023)
- David Nutt et al., **Drug Science: 5-Level Scale of Harm** (2010)

### Author Commentary & Notes
1] The original Robert Anton Wilson and Terence McKenna era material tends to be a bit vague overall despite references to machine elves and various sub-experiences, including McKenna's own chronicles of what the mushrooms told him. Possibly culminating with Leary and RAW's 8-Circuit model (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-circuit_model_of_consciousness>).

2] The works of Wasson and others, whose primary thrust was tying psychedelics back to Eleusis. These have relatively sparse detailed documentation.

3] **Erowid** is a great repository of entheogenic information but relatively light on taxonomies.

4] The work of Strassman et al. is "scientific" but light on details of inner experiences and was basically unfinished.

4] The “Entities” Facebook group (~14 k members) categorises beings encountered in DMT trips (<https://www.facebook.com/groups/174694074873217>).

5] The DMT-Nexus *Hyperspace Lexicon* further catalogues entities, breaking them into “good” and “evil” meta-categories – <https://wiki.dmt-nexus.me/Hyperspace_lexicon>.

6] **PsychonautWiki / Effect Index** offers a mindstate taxonomy while avoiding ontological claims. Intro talk: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zFB5TvqodQ> – Index: <https://www.effectindex.com/>.

7] **Alien Information Theory** (<https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43999264-alien-information-theory>) presents a comprehensive take by a biochemist on how cellular automata may create perceived reality—a grand DMT-based theory.

8] **Qualia Research Institute** output tends toward mathematical approaches and neologisms like “Neural Annealing,” surmising that healing happens via certain neural stimulation available during these experiences. Their paper on hyperbolic geometries aligns well with other internal research fronts.

9] Alexander Shulgin's original writings—including **PiHKAL** and **TiHKAL**—plus recordings of the lecture series *The Nature of Drugs* (see review <https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/11/book-review-pihkal>).

10] Benny Shanon, **The Antipodes of the Mind: Charting the Phenomenology of the Ayahuasca Experience** (2002) remains the most exhaustive and comprehensive from both anthropological and phenomenological standpoints.

_This bibliography marries classic texts, cutting-edge neuroscience, online taxonomies, and safety resources to map the landscape of extended states research._
