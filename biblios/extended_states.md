1] The original Robert Anton Wilson and Terrance McKenna era stuff which tends to be a bit vague overall despite references to machine elves and various sub-experiences, including McKenna's own chronicles of what the mushrooms told him. Possibly culminating with Leary and RAW's 8 Circuit model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-circuit_model_of_consciousness) 

2] The works of Wasson and others. whose primary thrust was tying them back to Eleusis. These have relatively sparse detailed documentation. 

3] Erowid a great repository of entheogenic information but relatively light on Taxonomies.

4] the work of Strassman et all which is "scientific" but light on details of inner experiences and was basically unfinished.  

4] The entities, a group of 14,000 people on Facebook categorizing entities they have found in DMT trips (https://www.facebook.com/groups/174694074873217)

5] Also concerning a sort of entity and inner catalogue, incluing  breaking them down to "good" and "evil" meta-categories  https://wiki.dmt-nexus.me/Hyperspace_lexicon

6] Mindstate / Psychonaut Wiki version of the same things which avoids taking ontological claims:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zFB5TvqodQ Includes the effect index.  https://www.effectindex.com/

7] Alien Information Theory (https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43999264-alien-information-theory) one of the more comprehensive take by a biochemist on how cellular automata may 'create the reality we perceive." Effectively a grand theory based on DMT.

8] The output of the Qualia Research Institute and associated groups which tends towards a mathematical type approach and various neologisms like "Neural Annealing" by which they basically surmise that healing happens though certain types of neural stimulation that is especially available during these types of experiences. I especially liked their paper about hyperbolic geometries as it aligns well with other things we have going on the research front. 

9] Alexander Shulgin's original writings including, Pihkal and Tihkal, and the recordings of the lecture series â€˜The nature of drugs'

10] The Antipodes of the Mind: Charting the Phenomenology of the Ayahuasca Experience by Benny Shanon.  Probably the most exhaustive and comprehenisve of all of them from both an anthrpological and phenomenological standpoint.
