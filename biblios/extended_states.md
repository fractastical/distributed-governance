Altered & Extended States of Consciousness Bibliography
=====================================================

_A curated reading list on psychedelic, entheogenic, and technologically-mediated states of consciousness, covering history, phenomenology, neuroscience, and cultural impact._

### Classic Psychedelic Literature
- Timothy Leary, Robert Anton Wilson & co., **The Eight-Circuit Model of Consciousness** – https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-circuit_model_of_consciousness (early heuristic model; references “machine elves” and other sub-experiences but often considered conceptually rough)
- Terence McKenna, **True Hallucinations** (1993) & recorded lectures
- Aldous Huxley, **The Doors of Perception / Heaven and Hell** (1954/1956)
- Carlos Castaneda, **The Teachings of Don Juan** (1968)

### Ethnobotany & Historical Roots
- R. Gordon Wasson, **Soma: Divine Mushroom of Immortality** (1968) (traces entheogens back to Eleusis; limited phenomenological detail)
- Jeremy Narby, **The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge** (1998)
- **Eleusinian Mysteries** scholarship (e.g., Muraresku, *The Immortality Key*, 2020)

### Pharmacopeia & Chemistry
- Alexander & Ann Shulgin, **PiHKAL** (1991) and **TiHKAL** (1997)
- David E. Nichols, papers on tryptamine & phenethylamine pharmacology
- **Erowid** Chemical Vault – https://erowid.org/ (comprehensive substance repository, though light on formal taxonomies)

### Taxonomies & Online Databases
- **PsychonautWiki** / **Effect Index** – https://www.effectindex.com/ (mind-state taxonomy that avoids ontological claims)
- **DMT-Nexus Hyperspace Lexicon** – https://wiki.dmt-nexus.me/Hyperspace_lexicon (community-driven entity catalogue; classifies “good” vs “evil” archetypes)
- Facebook “DMT Entities” group (~14 k members) – crowdsourced entity catalogue of beings encountered in DMT experiences)

### Scientific Research & Neuroscience
- Rick Strassman, **DMT: The Spirit Molecule** (2001) + follow-up studies (first modern clinical work on DMT; rigorous yet sparse on subjective phenomenology)
- Johns Hopkins Psychedelic Research Center – psilocybin, 5-MeO-DMT clinical trials
- Robin Carhart-Harris et al., “Entropic Brain” & REBUS models (2014-2021)
- MAPS-sponsored Phase 3 MDMA-PTSD trials (2021)
- Qualia Research Institute, “Neural Annealing” (2019) & hyperbolic geometry papers (mathematically-oriented theory suggesting healing via energy dissipation during high-entropy states)

### Theoretical Frameworks
- Andrew R. Gallimore, **Alien Information Theory** (2019)
- Benny Shanon, **Antipodes of the Mind** (2002) – phenomenology of ayahuasca
- Stanislav Grof, **Realms of the Human Unconscious** (1975) & **Holotropic Breathwork**
- Michael Pollan, **How to Change Your Mind** (2018) – mainstream synthesis

### Phenomenology & Entity Catalogues
- “Entities” project survey (>14k DMT reports)
- Benny Shanon’s ayahuasca archetypes vs. DMT-Nexus lexicon

### Technology-Mediated States
- Neural-feedback induced “Hyperscanning” studies (2020-)
- VR-assisted psychedelic therapy pilots (e.g., Lu et al., 2022)

### Safety, Ethics & Integration
- Fireside Project, **Psychedelic Peer Support Line** – https://firesideproject.org/
- Johns Hopkins “Psychedelic Safety Guidelines” (2023)
- David Nutt et al., **Drug Science: 5-Level Scale of Harm** (2010)

8] **Alien Information Theory** (<https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43999264-alien-information-theory>) presents a comprehensive take by a biochemist on how cellular automata may create perceived reality—a grand DMT-based theory.

9] **Qualia Research Institute** output tends toward mathematical approaches and neologisms like “Neural Annealing,” surmising that healing happens via certain neural stimulation available during these experiences. Their paper on hyperbolic geometries aligns well with other internal research fronts.

10] Alexander Shulgin's original writings—including **PiHKAL** and **TiHKAL**—plus recordings of the lecture series *The Nature of Drugs* (see review <https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/11/book-review-pihkal>).

11] Benny Shanon, **The Antipodes of the Mind: Charting the Phenomenology of the Ayahuasca Experience** (2002) remains the most exhaustive and comprehensive from both anthropological and phenomenological standpoints.
