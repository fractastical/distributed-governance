MetaMonastery Manifesto


Intro: the MetaMonastery currently exists in manifesto form. It will exist until there is a 3-5 founding group for the first MetaMonastery willing to accept some variant of these rules and a place found to instantiate the first MetaMonastery. 

[0] The MetaMonastery is inspired by traditional Christian, Buddhist, and Yogic monastic orders with the addition of technological forms of gnosis, quantitative self, and process optimization techniques. As such it attempts to create a new monastic order for the MetaAge. It was inspired by the Meta Villa, a community which existed in Silicon Valley for five years and MetaModernism.  

[1] This is a nomic ruleset, it is transparent by design and can be modified so long as the changes are recorded and also made transparent, along with a backlog of all changes (this is readily available a version tracking systems). The person committing to the ruleset is committing only to the rule set as it exists at a particular time. As of now, only the founding Abbot has the ability to change the rules. 

[2] The MetaMonastery consists of MetaMonks who make a lifelong commitment toward the pursuit of higher vibrations (which can be described as “God” or otherwise). Additionally, it intends to be a “city on a hill” and, as such, attempts to pioneer and set new societal models. 

[3]  A person becomes a MetaMonk three stages, a short visit, a year long visit, and a life long commitment. During the year long visit one commits to the rules of the metamonestary and if, after a shorter visit, they decide they want to continue. 

[4] The MetaMonastery consists of regular practices that are committed to by all MetaMonks, including regular meditation, yogic breathing practices, fitness and bodily awareness practices, the cultivation of sexual energy (often by abstinence), and work.  

[5] MetaMonks use a cycle to write down their commitments which is submitted to their superior and which is reviewed on a lunar cycle. Each commitment must be written down in a quantifiable format and first evaluated by the monk in their process. All cycles reports are kept in a register and a longer evaluation is done once per year. This will include regular testing of core metrics for Metamonks relative to fitness, dexterity, and mental acuity. 

[6] MetaMonks are given certain allowances for sexual activities as described in the above format provided that they fall into a framework for self-cultivation. By default this consists of 24 allowances for full and new moon cycles. 

[7] Metamonks go though cycles of imagination and execution, expansion and focus, sensory elation and negation. 

[8] MetaMonks do not have private property. That said, if they have children or other dependents special allowances may be made so that these have adequate means. Any private property in the lead up to the one year dedication period can be held in escrow.  

[9] The MetaMonastery will be practicing a communal ritual and liturgy which consists of chanting and music, with specific focus on polyrhythms. 

[10] Each MetaMonastery consists of an abbot, metamonks, and acolytes (MetaMonks that have not yet made a lifelong commitment), More complex governance systems can be setup at the discretion of the abbot. To be considered a MetaMonastery you must have at least three members. 

[11] Space of the MetaMonastery will be assumed for MetaMonks only except where specific provisions have been made (i.e. open access areas or visiting hours).

[12] Metamonks are expected to be industrious and have revenue generating projects which go in excess. The MetaMonastery will accept donations for the expansion of specific services.
